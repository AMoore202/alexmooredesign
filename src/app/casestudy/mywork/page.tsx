            <p className={styles.summary}>
              Over the years, the login modal for the SmartSuite application had
              gotten a little stale and wasnâ€™t capturing the feel of our brand.
              In my redesign, I wanted to create something that felt modern and
              professional. Additionally, the old design loaded a heavy image
              that caused delays when on a slower network. In the new design I
              used an svg for the background graphic and layer blur on the side
              image, but reducing the amount of time needed to load.

              My mom and I are big music fans and have both started collecting
              vinyl. Records make the perfect gift for any occasion but it is
              always a challenge to know which records we each already have. As
              a fun side project, I designed an app that would serve as a
              digital copy of our record collections so we could easily see what
              we do and do not have.

              As a self-proclaimed bird nerd, I quite enjoy a weekend trail walk
              to see all the local birds. My go-to app for tracking the birds I
              see is eBird. As a design experiment a designed a dashboard for
              the app and also created a sample marketing page using the assets
              from the dashboard.
